                            Players in the card game bingo cross off numbers as
                            a caller selects numbers at random. Being the first
                            to complete a predetermined pattern—typically a
                            line—and yell "Bingo!" is the goal. In order to win,
                            you must swiftly mark the numbers on your card
                            before anybody else and pay great attention to the
                            numbers being called. The game is quite flexible and
                            may be customised for a wide range of environments,
                            including social events and virtual spaces.
